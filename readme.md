# Farlands
Ports the far lands to Fabric 1.17! Also allows you to teleport past 30 million blocks and removes the world border limit completely.

Noteable bugs:
* Noise caves are fully flooded at the moment to fix a bug where aquifer generation fails in the far lands
* The lighting engine doesn't work after 2^25 blocks horizontally
